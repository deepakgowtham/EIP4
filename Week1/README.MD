Convolution:
Convolution is the dot product of matrix and a kernel applied multiple times over the matrix to obtain a matrix with less dimension.

Filters/Kernels:
Kernels are the matrix with weights that is used in convolution. The weights depends on the dataset, and obtained by training the model.

Epochs:
When training a dataset in batches, an epoch is the complete run on all the samples in the dataset.

1x1 Convolution:
Convolution done with 1X1 kernel, to combine the number of samples/features to reduce the dimension of samples.

3x3 Convolution:
Convolution with 3x3 kernel to obtain a feature matrix that is smaller by 2 across the dimension of the original matrix.

Feature Maps:
Resultant of the convolution of matrix and kernel, that contains some of the features from original matrix.

Activation Function:
Activation function is applied at each node of neural network, to the product and sum operation of features and weights.

Receptive Field:
The dimension of the window in the original matrix to which convolution is applied, the receptive field increases as the convolution layers increases.
